- **Data Validation:** Ensure data accuracy and completeness with required fields, date restrictions, and card number validation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

For the application to succesfully run, you need to install the following packages:

- flask (version 2.2.2)
- pyodbc (version 4.0.39)
- SQLAlchemy (version 2.0.21)
- werkzeug (version 2.2.3)

### Usage

To run the application, you simply need to run the `app.py` script in this repository. Once the application starts you should be able to access it locally at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. Here you will be meet with the following two pages:

1. **Order List Page:** Navigate to the "Order List" page to view all existing orders. Use the pagination controls to navigate between pages.

2. **Add New Order Page:** Click on the "Add New Order" tab to access the order form. Complete all required fields and ensure that your entries meet the specified criteria.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Flask is used to build the backend of the application, handling routing, data processing, and interactions with the database.

- **Frontend:** The user interface is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience.

- **Database:** The application employs an Azure SQL Database as its database system to store order-related data.

## Change Notes

### Features

#### Delivery Date 
This feature flag can be used to help show when the package will be delivered. It adds a delivery date column to the database and adds mapping to it in the backend to allow data transfer to and from the server and client. As well as adding elements to the HTML to show to the user.

#### Docker Containerisation
Created a docker file to help containerize the python application so it can be shared with other.

##### Steps

  1. Selected base image from which the application will run and also has capability to run flask
  2. Created the working directory where the application will work from and allows for web applications
  3. Copy all files from working directory locally to the directory in the container
  4. Installed all python dependencies from requirements.txt, while copying the file to the working directory of the container.
  5. Exposed the ports for 5000 (tcp) for data packet transfer between web browser and the container.
  6. Command to run the application using CMD.

#### Terraform
Adds three files to help build infrastructure for Azure. These files include variables, outputs and the main. The main file builds the virtual network and NSG (network security groups). The NSG has two rules to allow Kubernetes and SSH protocol access to the virtual network.
